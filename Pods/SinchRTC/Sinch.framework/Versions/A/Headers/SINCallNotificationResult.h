/**
 * SINCallNotificationResult is used to indicate the result of calling the methods
 * -[SINClient relayLocalNotification:] and
 * -[SINClient relayRemotePushNotificationPayload:]
 * , when the Sinch-specific payload in the notification represents an incoming
 * call.
 *
 * One example of a scenario where SINCallNotificationResult is when a user
 * have been attempted to be reached, but not acted on the notification directly.
 * In that case, the notification result object can indicate that the
 * notification is too old (`isTimedOut`), and also contains the `remoteUserId`
 * which can be used for display purposes.
